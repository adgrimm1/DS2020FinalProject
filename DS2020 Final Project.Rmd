## **Importing The Data**

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
data_frame <- readr::read_csv("C:\\Users\\grimm\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Iowa State Fall 2024\\DS2020\\Final Project\\DS2020 Final Project\\PLACES__Local_Data_for_Better_Health__Census_Tract_Data_2024_release_20241214.csv")


head(data_frame)

```

**Step: Survey** - Have a look at data types, data frame dimensions, and
values

```{R}
str(data_frame)
dim(data_frame)
summary(data_frame)
sapply(data_frame, class)
colnames(data_frame)
```

Note 1: Data frame measurement 3,183,048 rows, 24 columns

Note 2: Numeric, Character, Logical values present

```{R}

length(unique(data_frame$Year))
unique(data_frame$Year)

length(unique(data_frame$StateAbbr))
unique(data_frame$StateAbbr)

length(unique(data_frame$Category))
unique(data_frame$Category)

length(unique(data_frame$Measure))
unique(data_frame$Measure)

length(unique(data_frame$Data_Value_Unit))
unique(data_frame$Data_Value_Unit)

length(unique(data_frame$Data_Value_Type))
unique(data_frame$Data_Value_Type)


```

Note 1: Data is only for 2020,2021, I thought it would be more.

Note 2: The Data is for all 51 states, but no territories.

Note 3: There are six values for the "Category" column, Disability,
Health Outcomes, Prevention, Health Risk Behaviors, Health Status,
Health-Related Social Needs

Note 4: There are 40 values for the "Measures" column. There are likely
multiple for each category, but I'm not going to check that here.

Note 5: There is only 1 value for Data_Value_Unit %. This percentile all
units for for percentile

# Cleaning

**Step : Cleaning** - Looking for Null Values

```{R}

#Count the number of null and non null for each column
null_counts <- sapply(data_frame, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
non_null_counts <- sapply(data_frame, function(x) sum(!is.na(x)))

#Create small table to see the number of null non-null for each column
null_summary <- data.frame(
  Column = names(data_frame),
  Null_Count = null_counts,
  Non_Null_Count = non_null_counts
)
#display table
null_summary

```

Note 1: Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol and Data_Value_Footnote both have
3,183,048 null counts which is the same as the number of rows. Both of
these rows can be eliminated

**Step: Cleaning -** Remove Unneeded columns Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol
and Data_Value_Footnote

```{R}

data_frame <- data_frame[, !(colnames(data_frame) %in% c("Data_Value_Footnote", "Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol"))]

colnames(data_frame)
head(data_frame)

```

Note 1: Dataframe is now 3183048 by 22 now

# Data Manipulation/Organization

**Step: Data Manipulation** -Find National, State, County Average,Median
and Mode for each Measure So I can compare each state and county against
the National Average.

```{R}
library(dplyr)

get_mode <- function(x) {
  uniq_x <- unique(na.omit(x))    
  uniq_x[which.max(tabulate(match(x, uniq_x)))]
}


national_stats <- data_frame %>%
  group_by(Year, Measure) %>%
  summarise(
    National_Average = mean(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    National_Median = median(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    National_Mode = get_mode(Data_Value)
  )
state_stats <- data_frame %>%
  group_by(Year, StateAbbr, Measure) %>%
  summarise(
    State_Average = mean(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    State_Median = median(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    State_Mode = get_mode(Data_Value)
  )
county_stats <- data_frame %>%
  group_by(Year, StateAbbr, CountyName, Measure) %>%
  summarise(
    County_Average = mean(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    County_Median = median(Data_Value, na.rm = TRUE),
    County_Mode = get_mode(Data_Value)
  )

data_frame <- left_join(data_frame, national_stats, by = c("Year", "Measure"))

# Join State stats
data_frame <- left_join(data_frame, state_stats, by = c("Year", "StateAbbr", "Measure"))

# Join County stats
data_frame <- left_join(data_frame, county_stats, by = c("Year", "StateAbbr", "CountyName", "Measure"))

# View the updated data frame
print(head(data_frame))

```

**Step: Data Manipulation** - Comparing national averages to state and
county and creating new columns

```{R}
data_frame <- data_frame %>%
  mutate(
    # Differences between State and National statistics
    State_National_Avg_Diff = State_Average - National_Average,
    State_National_Med_Diff = State_Median - National_Median,
    State_National_Mode_Diff = State_Mode - National_Mode,

    # Differences between County and National statistics
    County_National_Avg_Diff = County_Average - National_Average,
    County_National_Med_Diff = County_Median - National_Median,
    County_National_Mode_Diff = County_Mode - National_Mode,

    # Differences between County and State statistics
    County_State_Avg_Diff = County_Average - State_Average,
    County_State_Med_Diff = County_Median - State_Median,
    County_State_Mode_Diff = County_Mode - State_Mode
  )

# View updated data frame
print(head(data_frame))
```

**Step: Data Manipulation** - Distinguish "Measures" with positive vs
negative outcomes.

```{R}
# Create list of positive and negative measures
positive_measures <- c(
  "Cholesterol screening among adults",
  "Visited dentist or dental clinic in the past year among adults",
  "Visits to doctor for routine checkup within the past year among adults",
  "Colorectal cancer screening among adults aged 45â€“75 years",
  "Mammography use among women aged 50-74 years"
)

# Add Category_Type column 
data_frame <- data_frame %>%
  mutate(
    Category_Type = ifelse(Measure %in% positive_measures, "Positive", "Negative")
  )

# Check the updated data
head(data_frame)
```

# **Data Exploration**

**Step: Data Exploration** - Reverse rank count for positive measures

```{R}
data_frame <- data_frame %>%
  group_by(Year, Measure) %>%
  mutate(
    # Adjust State Rank: Reverse for positive measures
    State_Rank = ifelse(Category_Type == "Positive", 
                        dense_rank(desc(State_National_Avg_Diff)),  # Reverse rank for Positive
                        dense_rank(State_National_Avg_Diff))        # Normal rank for Negative
  ) %>%
  group_by(Year, StateAbbr, Measure) %>%
  mutate(
    # Adjust County Rank: Reverse for positive measures
    County_Rank = ifelse(Category_Type == "Positive",
                         dense_rank(desc(County_State_Avg_Diff)),   # Reverse rank for Positive
                         dense_rank(County_State_Avg_Diff))         # Normal rank for Negative
  ) %>%
  ungroup() # Remove grouping to avoid conflicts later

# View the updated data frame
print(head(data_frame))
```

**Step: Data Exploration** - Ranking each state based on how it compares
to national average for each "Measure", and averaging all of each
state's "Measures" together and applying overall rank. For instances of
"Ties that occur in the Average_State_Rank the state with a higher
percentage of counties above the national average wins the tie.

```{R}


county_percentage <- data_frame %>%
  group_by(Year, StateAbbr) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Counties = n(),
    Counties_Above_National = sum(County_National_Avg_Diff > 0, na.rm = TRUE),
    Percentage_Above_National = (Counties_Above_National / Total_Counties) * 100
  )


state_yearly_ranks <- data_frame %>%
  group_by(Year, StateAbbr) %>%
  summarise(
    Average_State_Rank = mean(State_Rank, na.rm = TRUE) # Average rank per state and year
  ) %>%
  left_join(county_percentage, by = c("Year", "StateAbbr")) %>% # Join with percentages
  group_by(Year) %>%
  arrange(Year, Average_State_Rank, desc(Percentage_Above_National)) %>% # Sort by rank and tie-breaker
  mutate(
    Overall_Rank = row_number() # Assign unique ranks based on sorted order
  ) %>%
  ungroup()


print(state_yearly_ranks)
```

**Step: Data Exploration -** Separated original graph into increasing
rank, decreasing rank, and no movement

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


rank_movement <- state_yearly_ranks %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(2021, 2022)) %>% # Focus only on 2021 and 2022
  select(StateAbbr, Year, Overall_Rank) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Overall_Rank, names_prefix = "Rank_") %>%
  mutate(
    Rank_Change = Rank_2021 - Rank_2022, # Positive = moved up, Negative = moved down
    Movement_Category = case_when(
      Rank_Change > 0 ~ "Up",       # Improved in rank
      Rank_Change < 0 ~ "Down",     # Worsened in rank
      Rank_Change == 0 ~ "Same"     # Stayed the same
    )
  )


state_yearly_ranks_with_movement <- state_yearly_ranks %>%
  left_join(rank_movement %>% select(StateAbbr, Movement_Category), by = "StateAbbr")

up_states <- state_yearly_ranks_with_movement %>%
  filter(Movement_Category == "Up")


ggplot(up_states, aes(x = Year, y = Overall_Rank, group = StateAbbr, color = StateAbbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2021, 2022), labels = c("2021", "2022")) +
  scale_y_reverse() + # Reverse y-axis so rank 1 is at the top
  labs(
    title = "States that Improved in Rank (2021-2022)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Overall Rank",
    color = "State"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "right"
  )
                
```

Notes: For states that moving up in rank, it seems like there is about
and equal amount of state jumping several spots and others gradually
increasing.

```{R}
# Filter for "Down" states
down_states <- state_yearly_ranks_with_movement %>%
  filter(Movement_Category == "Down")

# Plot for States that Worsened in Rank
ggplot(down_states, aes(x = Year, y = Overall_Rank, group = StateAbbr, color = StateAbbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2021, 2022), labels = c("2021", "2022")) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(
    title = "States that Worsened in Rank (2021-2022)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Overall Rank",
    color = "State"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "right"
  )
```

Notes: It seems like about ten states had significant health rank
changes from 2021 to 2022

```{R}
same_states <- state_yearly_ranks_with_movement %>%
  filter(Movement_Category == "Same")

# Plot for States that Stayed the Same
ggplot(same_states, aes(x = Year, y = Overall_Rank, group = StateAbbr, color = StateAbbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2021, 2022), labels = c("2021", "2022")) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(
    title = "States that Stayed the Same in Rank (2021-2022)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Overall Rank",
    color = "State"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "right"
  )
```

Note: Only WV maintained its position.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

filtered_state_ranks <- state_yearly_ranks %>%
  filter(!is.na(StateAbbr) & StateAbbr != "FL")

# Step 1: Reorder StateAbbr based on 2021 ranks
state_order <- state_yearly_ranks %>%
  filter(Year == 2021) %>%
  arrange(Overall_Rank) %>% # Arrange by rank so top-ranked states are first
  pull(StateAbbr)           # Extract the ordered list of states

# Step 2: Update StateAbbr as a factor with the desired order
state_yearly_ranks <- state_yearly_ranks %>%
  mutate(StateAbbr = factor(StateAbbr, levels = state_order))

ggplot(filtered_state_ranks, aes(x = Year, y = StateAbbr, fill = Overall_Rank)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2021, 2022), labels = c("2021", "2022")) + # Only display 2021 and 2022
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkgreen", high = "red") + # Dark green = good rank, Red = poor rank
  labs(
    title = "State Rankings Heatmap by Year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "State (Ordered by 2021 Rank)",
    fill = "Rank"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)
  )
```

Note: Data from Florida (appearing as NA) 2021 is missing this will
slightly skew the rankings, but hopefully not as much as as they were
previously. Most it seems like states that were higher ranked stated
higher ranked, mid rank seems like it moved both directions equally, and
the bottom ranking stayed at the bottom for the most but some moved up
significantly.

Note: I removed florida from charts

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ggplot(filtered_state_ranks, aes(x = reorder(StateAbbr, -Average_State_Rank), y = Average_State_Rank)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = as.factor(Year)), show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ Year) + # Separate panels for 2021 and 2022
  labs(
    title = "Average State Rankings by Year (Excluding Florida)",
    x = "State",
    y = "Average Rank"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```

```{R}
# Filter for Top 5 and Bottom 5 states
top_bottom_states <- state_yearly_ranks %>%
  group_by(StateAbbr) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Rank = mean(Overall_Rank)) %>%
  arrange(Avg_Rank) %>%
  filter(row_number() <= 5 | row_number() > (n() - 5))

# Join back to state_yearly_ranks
filtered_ranks <- state_yearly_ranks %>%
  filter(StateAbbr %in% top_bottom_states$StateAbbr)

# Plot
ggplot(filtered_ranks, aes(x = Year, y = Overall_Rank, group = StateAbbr, color = StateAbbr)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2021, 2022), labels = c("2021", "2022")) + # Only show 2021 and 2022
  scale_y_reverse() + # Reverse y-axis so rank 1 is at the top
  facet_wrap(~ StateAbbr, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Top and Bottom 5 States' Rankings Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Overall Rank",
    color = "State"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10) # Adjust x-axis text size
  )
```

Note: Of the top and bottom states they seem to be consistent with the
number of states that increase vs decrease. I am starting to notice that
MS, AL, WV and KY are consistently in the bottom of health outcomes.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)

# Get map data for US states
us_states <- map_data("state") # Fetches state boundary data
us_states$region <- tolower(us_states$region)

# Prepare the filtered state ranks data
filtered_state_ranks_clean <- filtered_state_ranks %>%
  filter(!is.na(Year)) %>%  # Remove rows where Year is NA
  mutate(region = tolower(state.name[match(StateAbbr, state.abb)])) %>%
  filter(!is.na(region))  # Remove rows where region is NA

# Merge filtered state ranks with map data
map_data_ranks <- us_states %>%
  left_join(filtered_state_ranks_clean, by = "region")

# Plot the U.S. map with state rankings
ggplot(map_data_ranks, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Overall_Rank)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white", size = 0.4) + # Adds borders around states
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", na.value = "grey80") + # Color scale
  coord_fixed(1.3) + # Ensures aspect ratio of the map
  facet_wrap(~ Year) + # Creates separate maps for each year
  labs(
    title = "State Rankings by Year",
    fill = "Rank"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Note: Florida excluded from dataset appears in NA. I'm also realizing
that Hawaii and Alaska are not on the map. A negative health trend in
the midwest to south seems to be appearing, with better health on the
coasts and north.

**Data Manipulation**

```{R}
# Summarize State_Rank for each Year, StateAbbr, and Measure
state_ranks_by_measure <- data_frame %>%
  group_by(Year, StateAbbr, MeasureId) %>%
  summarise(
    State_Rank = mean(State_Rank, na.rm = TRUE) # Take average rank in case of duplicates
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# View the new data frame
head(state_ranks_by_measure)



```

**Data Manipulation - Making sure state abbreviation shows up next to
result**

```{R}
# Add lowercase state names for merging
state_ranks_by_measure$region <- tolower(state.name[match(state_ranks_by_measure$StateAbbr, state.abb)])
```

**Data Manipulation - Matching map data with ranks from my dataset**

```{R}
# Get US states map data
us_states <- map_data("state")

# Merge map data with rankings
map_data_ranks <- us_states %>%
  left_join(state_ranks_by_measure, by = "region")

# Confirm that all required columns exist
head(map_data_ranks)
```

```{R}
# Filter data for 2021
map_data_ranks_2021 <- map_data_ranks %>%
  filter(Year == 2021)

# Plot grid of U.S. maps for 2021
ggplot(map_data_ranks_2021, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = State_Rank)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white", size = 0.2) + # State borders
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", na.value = "grey80") + # Blue = better, red = worse
  coord_fixed(1.3) + # Fix aspect ratio
  facet_wrap(~ MeasureId, ncol = 4) + # Arrange maps in a grid with 4 columns
  labs(
    title = "State Rankings by Measure - 2021",
    fill = "State Rank"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 8), # Adjust facet label size for readability
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5) # Center and enlarge the title
  )

```
Note: I think I broke this map when trying to separate the year 2021 and 2022

```{R}
# Filter data for 2022
map_data_ranks_2022 <- map_data_ranks %>%
  filter(Year == 2022)

    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5) # Center and enlarge the title
  )
```

```{R}

state_measure_diff <- data_frame %>%
  select(Year, StateAbbr, MeasureId, State_National_Avg_Diff, Category_Type) %>%
  distinct() # Remove duplicates, if any


print(head(state_measure_diff))



```

```{R}
us_states <- map_data("state")

state_measure_diff$region <- tolower(state.name[match(state_measure_diff$StateAbbr, state.abb)])

# Merge map data with state-level differences
map_data_states <- us_states %>%
  left_join(state_measure_diff, by = "region")

# Split data for positive and negative Category_Type
positive_data <- map_data_states %>% filter(Category_Type == "Positive")
negative_data <- map_data_states %>% filter(Category_Type == "Negative")
```

```{R}
ggplot(positive_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = State_National_Avg_Diff)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white", size = 0.2) +

    low = "red", mid = "white", high = "blue", midpoint = 0, 
    limits = c(-15, 15), oob = scales::squish

  )
```
Note: It seems like checkups might only need to occur when cronic conditions are present indicating worse health conditions, 

This interactive graph is meant to show how states compare on different "Measures" because my previous graphs did a bad job.

NOte: Changed X axis title to be less confusing, from "Health score" to "Poor outcome health score" These states appear inline with the states that have negative trends in previous graphs. 

This graph is to show counties on a state level and how they compare to other counties within a state.

This Matrix is meant to find if there is a relationship between social needs, preventitive care measure, risky health behaviors and the actual health outcomes. 
```{R}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Define the selected measures
selected_measures <- c(
  "No leisure-time physical activity among adults",
  "Short sleep duration among adults",
  "Current cigarette smoking among adults",
  "Binge drinking among adults",
  "Obesity among adults",
  "High blood pressure among adults",
  "Frequent mental distress among adults",
  "Frequent physical distress among adults",
  "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among adults",
  "Diagnosed diabetes among adults"
)

# Filter, clean, and reshape the data
cor_data <- data_frame %>%
  filter(Measure %in% selected_measures) %>%
  select(StateAbbr, CountyName, Measure, Data_Value) %>%
  mutate(Data_Value = as.numeric(Data_Value)) %>%  # Ensure Data_Value is numeric
  pivot_wider(names_from = Measure, values_from = Data_Value) %>%
  na.omit()  # Remove rows with missing values

# Verify that all selected columns are numeric
cor_data
```

```{R}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Fix list-columns by extracting the mean value and converting to numeric
cor_data <- cor_data %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.list), ~ sapply(., function(x) mean(as.numeric(unlist(x)), na.rm = TRUE))))
```

Making sure my data is numeric and not lists
```{R}
sapply(cor_data, class)
```

```{R}
cor_numeric <- cor_data %>%
  select(-StateAbbr, -CountyName)

# Calculate correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(cor_numeric, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# Print the correlation matrix
print(cor_matrix)
```
Note: There are actually some very interesting results here, most of which are understandable. Obesity among adults is very related to diebetes and not having leisure time, and smoking. COPD is highly related to frequent pain distress in adults and High blood pressure. Some of the most interesting is the binge drinking have a negative correlation with almost all of the negative health outcomes. I was supprised there was a negative correlation between binge drinking and smoking. 


Visuilzation of Matrix. 
```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr) # For pivot_longer()

# Ensure the correlation matrix contains only numeric values
cor_matrix <- as.data.frame(cor_matrix) # Convert matrix to data frame for tidyr
cor_matrix$Var1 <- rownames(cor_matrix) # Preserve row names for x-axis

# Reshape the correlation matrix into long format
cor_long <- pivot_longer(cor_matrix, 
                         cols = -Var1,  # All columns except Var1
                         names_to = "Var2", 
                         values_to = "value")

# Plot the heatmap
ggplot(cor_long, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high = "blue", mid = "white",
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab",
                       name = "Correlation") +
  labs(
    title = "Correlation Between Health Behaviors and Outcomes",
    x = "", y = ""

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Conclusion: Health trends almost seem to be regional in the United states. The south was fairing worse in 2021 and 2022, but new england, the west coast and the upper midwest seem to be healthier areas to be. This also might be related to having better access to health insurance.
